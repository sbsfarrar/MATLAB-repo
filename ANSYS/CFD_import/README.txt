This MATLAB FileExchange entry contains files related to the episode "Processing CFD Simulation Data" (mathworks.com/racinglounge) << include full path when available >>

MATLAB Scripts:  
CFD_import.m: This script is the main script for importing CFD simulation results (WingDonwResults.txt) and visualizing these. Furthermore it calculates momentum balance and drag force and evaluates the swirling strength.
computeSwStr.m: This function is called by CFD_import.m and computes the swirling strength (vorticity) based on the Lambda Ci cirterion.  

DATA FILES:
WingDownResults.txt: CFD simulation result file from a wing in air flow.
